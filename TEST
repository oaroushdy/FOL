TESTING:

 Test each Step independently:
- Step 1: remove iff:
	 Sentence with iff
	 Sentence without iff

- Step 2: RemoveIF():
	 Sentence with iff 
	 Sentence without iff 
	
 Function:
ex: a iff b
Expression exp = new Sentence ( new Variable ("a"), Connector.IFF, new variable ("b"));
exp.Step1RemoveIFF();
System.out.println(exp);
